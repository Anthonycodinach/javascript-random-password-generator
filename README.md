# javascript-random-password-generator

## Description
This repo holds the code for a random password generator powered by JavaScript, CSS & HTML. This site will gerenarte for you on command a random password made up of the number of characters of your choice and use an assortment of numbers, upper & lower case letters and special characters.

## Installation
I recived starter code from another Github repo provided by my instructor.

## Usage
When a user clicks the button to generate a password they are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria. When prompted for the password criteria, the user must select which criteria to include in the password. When asked for character types to include in the password, the user then confirms whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. After the user answers each prompt, the input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected. After all the prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria. When the password is generated, the password is written on the page within the password cointainer.

## Credits
I authored all the code inside the JavaScript file, I was provided the CSS & HTML code from my proffessor. I did recive outside guidence from a TA during the class office hours but no code within JavaScript was outright authored by anyone outside of myself.

## Screenshot
I have not figured out how to add an image to the README file yet, working on that!
